Leverages Yahoo's web services to automatically assign tags to your posts and pages


== Description ==

The autotag plugin for WordPress leverages Yahoo's web services to automatically assign tags to your posts and pages.

To use it, activate and enjoy. A box will appear in your post editor. Things should be self-explanatory from there.

Note that by default, WordPress provides no tag support for static pages. When using Semiologic Pro, you can tag pages when the Silo Web Design plugin is enabled.

Also note that Yahoo's term extraction service will only serve individual IP addresses up to 5,000 times per 24-hours. If you're on a shared host or use this feature too often, you may end up with no additional tags. When this occurs, simply try again 24 hours later.
